# Send files without restrictions
Have you ever wanted to send a file through Discord or any other online platform but you couldnt because of its size? Well, here comes a solution.
# HOW TO USE
## Sender side
Put everything you want to send into a single ZIP file - nothing else, such as RAR is accepted. Run the app and select the new ZIP file you just created. Proceed to next step and choose where new, smaller files will be placed. It comes "out of box", so rather create a new folder for that. And input max allowed size on your chosen platform and hit "Split". You will be notified when its done. Then simply send all the small bin files to your friend.
## Receiver side
Once you received all the mini files you need, put them into a new folder !! THEY HAVE TO BE ALONE, WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE, JUST THOSE .BIN FILES!!. Open my app and click on "Merge" on the top of the screen, input all the fields, hit "Merge" and voilala, the original ZIP has been created into the chosen path.

If u try to split a really small files, under <5MB there might some bugs occurs, but who and why would do that?

## EVEN THOUGH I SAID "without restriction", ONLY UP TO 2GBs ARE SUPPORTED

### Btw, the app is so lightweight you can send it through Discord, lol
